4875916,Generalized Fractional-Order Bernoulli Functions via Riemann-Liouville Operator and Their Applications in the Evaluation of Dirichlet Series,12-Dec-18,Jorge Sanchez-Ortiz,In this work, we define a new class of functions of the Bernoulli type using the Riemann-Liouville fractional integral operator and derive a generating function for these class generalized functions. Then, these functions are employed to derive formulas for certain Dirichlet series.,1Facultad de Matemáticas, Universidad Autónoma de Guerrero, Av. Lázaro Cárdenas S/N, Cd.

2067304,An Inverse Source Problem for Singular Parabolic Equations with Interior Degeneracy,9-Dec-18,Khalid Atifi,Idriss Boutaayamou,Hamed Ould Sidi, and Jawad Salhi,The main purpose of this work is to study an inverse source problem for degenerate/singular parabolic equations with degeneracy and singularity occurring in the interior of the spatial domain. Using Carleman estimates, we prove a Lipschitz stability estimate for the source term provided that additional measurement data are given on a suitable interior subdomain. For the numerical solution, the reconstruction is formulated as a minimization problem using the output least squares approach with the Tikhonov regularization. The Fréchet differentiability of the Tikhonov functional and the Lipschitz continuity of the Fréchet gradient are proved. These properties allow us to apply gradient methods for numerical solution of the considered inverse source problem.,1Faculté des Sciences et Techniques, Université Hassan 1er, Laboratoire MISI, BP 577, Settat 26000, Morocco2Faculté Polydisciplinaire de Ouarzazate, Université Ibn Zohr, BP 638, Ouarzazate 45000, Morocco,Jawad Salhi,http://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/aaa/2018/2067304.pdf,,,,,,

In our previous work, we have analyzed the approximate controllability and observability of the nonautonomous Riesz-spectral systems including the nonautonomous Sturm-Liouville systems. As a continuation of the work, we are concerned with the analysis of stability, stabilizability, detectability, exact null controllability, and complete stabilizability of linear non-autonomous control systems in Banach spaces. The used analysis is a quasisemigroup approach. In this paper, the stability is identified by uniform exponential stability of the associated ,1Mathematics Department of Universitas Sebelas Maret, Surakarta, Indonesia2Mathematics Department of Universitas Gadjah Mada, Yogyakarta, Indonesia,Sutrima Sutrima,http://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/aaa/2018/3791609.pdf,,,

8479638,Global Dynamics of an SVEIR Model with Age-Dependent Vaccination,18-Jul-18, and Latency,,Rodrigue Yves M’pika Massoukou,Suares Clovis Oukouomi Noutchie, and Richard Guiem,,Vaccine-induced protection is substantial to control, prevent, and reduce the spread of infectious diseases and to get rid of infectious diseases. In this paper, we propose an SVEIR epidemic model with age-dependent vaccination, latency, and infection. The model also considers that the waning vaccine-induced immunity depends on vaccination age and the vaccinated individuals fall back to the susceptible class after losing immunity. The model is a coupled system of (hyperbolic) partial differential equations with ordinary differential equations. The global dynamics of the model is established through construction of appropriate Lyapunov functionals and application of Lasalle’s invariance principle. As a result, the global stability of the infection-free equilibrium and endemic equilibrium is obtained and is fully determined by the basic reproduction number ,1School of Mathematical and Statistical Sciences, North-West University, Mafikeng campus, Private Bag X2046, Mmabatho 2735, South Africa2National Advanced School of Engineering of Maroua, University of Maroua, P.O.

7345401,On the Rate of Convergence of P-Iteration,29-May-18, and D-Iteration Methods for Continuous Nondecreasing Functions on Closed Intervals,,Jukkrit Daengsaen and Anchalee Khemphet,We introduce a new iterative method called D-iteration to approximate a fixed point of continuous nondecreasing functions on arbitrary closed intervals. The purpose is to improve the rate of convergence compared to previous work. Specifically, our main result shows that D-iteration converges faster than P-iteration and SP-iteration to the fixed point. Consequently, we have that D-iteration converges faster than the others under the same computational cost. Moreover, the analogue of their convergence theorem holds for D-iteration.,1Department of Mathematics, Faculty of Science, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand2Center of Excellence in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics, Department of Mathematics, Faculty of Science, Chiang Mai University, Chiang Mai 50200, Thailand,Anchalee Khemphet,http://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/aaa/2018/7345401.pdf,,,,,,

Thus, applying the Haar type MRA based on symmetries to the MK problem, we obtain a sequence of transportation problem that approximates the original MK problem for each of MRA. Moreover, the optimal solutions of each level solution converge in the weak sense to the optimal solution of original problem.,1Facultad de Matemáticas, Universidad Veracruzana, Xalapa, VER, Mexico2Escuela Superior de Ingeniera Mecánica y Eléctrica, Instituto Politécnico Nacional, Mexico City, Mexico,Armando Sánchez-Nungaray,http://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/aaa/2018/1764175.pdf,,,,,,,,
